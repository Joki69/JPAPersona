He violates everywhere he pleases such as the hell for extending his lifespan and Celestial Court for stealing the Peaches of Immortality, and thus before the novel starts, he was well known for causing havoc that shook the heavens through his rebellious attitude, but has a soft side and cunning, confident exterior; though his personality is said to be very volatile."

He is the being who is the nearest in hierarchy to that of God. He is said to have the largest body among all of the angels, having 36 wings, 3 representing the triumvirate of the father (God), the son (Jesus Christ) and the holy ghost, multiplied by the 12 tribes of Israel (God's chosen people).

The contents of the document and even the circumstances in which it was purportedly found prove that it was not genuine[1], but due to coverage in occult magazines between the 1970s and early 2000s it's relatively often referenced in popculture. Inaccuracies include descriptions of natural disasters which never happened, scientific discoveries stated to occur in incorrect time periods, and references to XXth century urban legends in purported XVIIIth century chronicles. Arahabaki is also stated to be a god exclusively associated with the Tohoku region in it - however, most place names related to this deity aren't even located in the north[2]."
